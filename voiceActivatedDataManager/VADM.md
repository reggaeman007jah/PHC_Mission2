VADM allows the user to manage coord data created via VACF

Within VADM you can:

- Save up to 8 coords
- If you add a 9th, the oldest entry will be overwritten
- You can apply a label to any saved coord data (one of eight options)
- after adding a label to a coord, you can add another label to a subsequent coord
- this allows the user to capture several coords, and name them all in one go
- while in VADM you can delete any entry (not yet built)
- once coords have been labeled, they can be referenced by other modules
