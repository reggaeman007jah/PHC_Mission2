Welcome Player

This mission has the Voice Activated Artillery System running for all players

Each player in the mission has access to:

1 targetted Hellfire (GBU) missile

50 HE artillery rounds

10 artillery smokes (standard colours)

10 artillery flares (standard colours)

In addition to the VAA System, the player also has access to the VACF System

VACF enables you to determine a specific 10-grid location using only a range finder and compass

It is recommended that both the VAA and VACF systems are used with the VAMP Voice Attack profile

VAMP has all of the required voice commands to enable your usage of the VAA and VACF systems

You are of course able to change the voice commands, however this documentation will refer to the provided voice commands

---

Task 1 - Activate VACF

Visually locate an area some distance away, and view it through your rangefinder. Ensure you press 't' to generate the distance calc

Now activate VACF - current commands to activate are:

Activate Range Finder

Activate G P S Tracker

(you can add more of course)

The on-screen display will now invite you to enter numbers using just your voice

The first 5 numbers will confirm your heading, the last 4 numbers will confirm distance to your chosen point target

In order to calculate an accurate heading you'll need to confirm more than just the standard 3-number heading.

In real life, mils are used as degree points between each main heading number, however this system uses a simple decimal system

So, within VACF there are 10 points between, say, heading 251 and 252

In the above example, if you wanted an exact heading of, say, 251, you would actually need to enter 25150

In other words, 251-pure is halfway between 251 and 252

The further away you are looking the more important this rule becomes

Hence single shot hits against armour from long distances (4km+) require considerable skill and experience to calculate accurately

Once you have determined and spoken your 5-digit heading data, you'll need to simple enter your 4-digit distance

If your target point was, say, 952m away, you would say "0 9 5 2"

As a general rule, you are able to speak 'double numbers' such as "nine seven" "eight two" and so on.

You are also able to speak treble numbers upto 365 - anything over 365 must be spoken in double numbers
